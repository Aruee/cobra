# Cobra <img src="https://travis-ci.org/flatmap/cobra.svg?branch=master"/>

Cobra is a modern code and proof presentation framework, leveraging cutting-edge presentation technology together with a state of the art interactive theorem prover to present formalized mathematics as active documents. Cobra provides both an easy way to present proofs and a novel approach to auditorium interaction. The presentation is checked live by the theorem prover, and moreover allows live changes both by the presenter as well as the audience.

Cobra currently supports **Isabelle** proofs as well as **Scala** and **Haskell** code
